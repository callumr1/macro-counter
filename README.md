Macro Counter allows you to calculate the Calories, Protein, Carbs, and Fats for each ingredient in a recipe! It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and using Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind was chosen to allow for rapid mobile-first development and so I could learn utility-first CSS. It allowed me to focus on building a reliable responsive design whilst focusing on usability rather than CSS classes.

Some additional functionality I intend to look into in the future includes:
 - Add kj to calorie conversion for each ingredient.
 - Add kj to calorie conversion for total calories.
 - Potentially add an ingredient look-up via an api.
